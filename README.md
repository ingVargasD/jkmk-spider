5.1	Beatport (music site):

The client wanted a script who export a particular template to copy and paste in his website. 

5.1.1	Framework used: Scrapy.

Site: www.beatport.com
This client work per week with a lot of albums from this site, so, he contacted me to create a script when he put the album url:
Example:  https://www.beatport.com/release/recovery/3199108
And get a excel file with some information (album name, song name, autors)


 
 
The player Embed was the most important part of this work, this is how a normal embed look: 
<iframe src="https://embed.beatport.com/?id=14544634&type=track" width="100%" height="162" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" style="max-width:600px;"></iframe>
And this is the final result + the particular template that client demand. 
 

If you want to see a video example of how this script work contact me.
